1. Bank A is offering 100% interest every year
2. Bank B is offering 50% interest every half a year
Which deal is better?

Wait... there are few more banks...
3. Bank C is offering (100/12)% interest every month
4. Bank D is offering (100/365)% interest every day

Let's calculate a few of these values:
I have $1 in my bank

1. Bank A = (1 + 1)^1 = $2
2. Bank B = (1 + 0.5)^2 = $2.25
3. Bank C = (1 + 1/12)^12 = $2.61
And so on...

Conclusion:
More frequent >> More Money

Now,
What if the bank offers you continuous interest i.e. for every moment the interest will be calculated and added to your balance?

How much money will you make at the end of the year?
A. $2 < x < $3
B. $3 < x < $4
