The most successful people are often the most disciplined ones and
The most knowledgable people are often the most humble ones

I think we spend too much time being afraid of our own mediocrity. We don’t want to sing too loudly, in case any one finds out we don’t have a voice like glass. We don’t write music because we aren’t Mozart. We don’t paint because we aren’t Picasso. We don’t tell people that we love them. Because our voice may shake when we say it. We try to be pretty criers. We don’t dance because we aren’t that good. The reality of our humanity is that we all are little bit average at a lot of things. The truth is that we’re all that not good. So stop holding yourself back from enjoying the things you love because you’re not a prodigy at everything. Scream the song at the top of your lungs and confess your love and let your voice be shaky. Cry big ugly tears. Dance really badly because life is too short to be scared of being human.

Silence isn’t empty it’s full of answers.

I am here for a good time, not for a long time.

Destinies are not decided by the shoes you are in but the steps you take.

Ditch the endless planning. Life unfolds in the doing, not the blueprint. Jump in, get messy, and sculpt your masterpiece from the chaos.

“Why do you like thunderstorms?”
”Because it shows that even nature needs to scream sometimes.”

People only see the decisions you made,
Not the choices you had.

Study, think, create and grow. Teach yourself and teach others.

People leave, memories fade away and life goes on.

It is the mark of an educated mind to be able to entertain a thought without accepting it.

Being raised right doesn’t mean, you don’t drink, party or smoke. Being raised right is how you treat people, your manners and respect.

To be interesting, you have to be interested.

Respect is rooted in love, you can’t possibly love someone whom you don’t respect.

If you reveal your secrets to the wind, you should not blame the wind for revealing them to the trees.

Keep doing good things.
Your impact on other people is bigger than you think.
Someone still giggles when they think of that funny thing you said. Someone still smiles when they think of the compliment you gave then. Someone silently admires you.
The advice you give has made a difference for people. The support and love you’ve offered others has made someone’s day.  Your inputs and opinions have made someone think twice. Your existence makes positive difference, whether you see it or not.

Self-awareness, boundaries, emotional maturity, respect, honesty, clear communication, compassion, vulnerability and authenticity.

If it can be destroyed by truth, it deserves to be destroyed by the truth.

You put up walls so high that only the crazy would climb them to be with you.

If you are serious about growth, be serious about accountability. If you are serious about abundance, be serious about gratitude. If you are serious about intimacy, be serious about vulnerability. If you are serious about discipline, be serious about delayed gratification.

I heard this quote the other day:
“”If your child is a ‘C’ at math and a star in tennis, hire a tennis coach, not a math tutor.” And it’s stuck with me ever since.

He who has a why to live can bear almost anything.
