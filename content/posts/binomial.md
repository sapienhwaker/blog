Most of us in high school have seen the quadratic equation, which tells us how to solve the degree 2 polynomial equation:
ax² + bx + c = 0.

But what about the other polynomial equations with higher degrees?

In the 1500s, mathematicians solved the cubic equation (degree 3):
ax³ + bx² + cx + d = 0
The corresponding solution is far more complicated. Please check the 1st comment. Thank heavens we didn’t have to learn that in high school.

How about a quartic equation (degree 4)?
ax⁴ + bx³ + cx² + dx + e = 0?
At this point, the formula is absolutely ridiculous.
I dare you to check the second comment, click on the image, and scroll through the whole thing.

The quintic equation (degree 5)?
ax⁵ + bx⁴ + cx³ + dx² + ex + f = 0
Don't worry it doesn’t exist!

It’s not that mathematicians haven’t found it yet; they actually proved it’s impossible! In fact, for any polynomial with a degree of 5 or higher, there is no solution in roots.

In mathematics, it is known as Abel–Ruffini theorem (also known as Abel's impossibility theorem).

The theorem is named after Paolo Ruffini, who made an incomplete proof in 1799, and Niels Henrik Abel, who provided proof in 1824.
