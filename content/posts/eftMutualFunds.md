Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs) and mutual funds are both investment vehicles that allow individuals to invest in a diversified portfolio of assets, such as stocks, bonds, or other securities. However, there are several key differences between these two types of investment funds:

1. **Trading Method**:
   - **ETFs**: ETFs are traded on stock exchanges, just like individual stocks. This means you can buy and sell ETF shares throughout the trading day at market prices. ETF prices fluctuate continuously during trading hours.
   - **Mutual Funds**: Mutual funds are bought and sold at the end-of-day net asset value (NAV) price. You can place orders for mutual fund shares during the trading day, but the actual execution occurs at the NAV price calculated after the market closes.

2. **Price Determination**:
   - **ETFs**: ETF prices are determined by supply and demand in the market and can sometimes trade at a premium or discount to their underlying net asset value (NAV).
   - **Mutual Funds**: Mutual fund shares are bought or sold at the NAV price, which is calculated based on the closing prices of the underlying assets in the fund's portfolio.

3. **Management Style**:
   - **ETFs**: ETFs are typically passively managed, aiming to replicate the performance of an index or asset class. There are also actively managed ETFs, but they are less common.
   - **Mutual Funds**: Mutual funds can be either passively managed (index funds) or actively managed, where a portfolio manager actively selects and manages the fund's investments.

4. **Fees and Expenses**:
   - **ETFs**: ETFs generally have lower expense ratios compared to actively managed mutual funds. They are known for their transparency in disclosing fees.
   - **Mutual Funds**: Mutual funds can have higher expense ratios, especially for actively managed funds. Some fees, like sales loads, may also apply to mutual funds.

5. **Tax Efficiency**:
   - **ETFs**: ETFs are known for their tax efficiency because they are structured in a way that allows investors to minimize capital gains taxes. When you sell an ETF, you may incur capital gains taxes, but they tend to be lower and more controllable than with mutual funds.
   - **Mutual Funds**: Mutual funds can be less tax-efficient, as they may distribute capital gains to shareholders, which could lead to tax consequences even if you don't sell your shares.

6. **Minimum Investment**:
   - **ETFs**: ETFs have no minimum investment requirements beyond the cost of one share, which can make them accessible to a wide range of investors.
   - **Mutual Funds**: Mutual funds often have minimum investment requirements, which can vary widely depending on the fund company and the specific fund.

7. **Dividends and Distributions**:
   - **ETFs**: ETFs may pay dividends and capital gains less frequently than mutual funds. When they do, these distributions are usually reinvested or paid out in cash.
   - **Mutual Funds**: Mutual funds often distribute dividends and capital gains to shareholders more regularly, which can be a benefit or drawback depending on an investor's preferences and tax situation.

In summary, while ETFs and mutual funds both offer diversification and professional management, they differ in terms of trading, pricing, management style, fees, tax efficiency, and minimum investment requirements. The choice between the two depends on your investment goals, trading preferences, and the specific characteristics of the funds you are considering.
