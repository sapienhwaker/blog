Hello there! welcome to my personal blog.

I try to read and write on various topics. The width of spectrum is considerably high, here you will get read about history, geography, maths, science, computers, sports, politics, cookery etc. Please feel free to check the tags sections to read about specific topic.

About myself in one line:
I am curios, competitive and compassionate.

About myself in few more lines:
I am a decent software developer. Born in Maharashtra, India. Living in California, USA.
I am sports freak. I love to play Golf, Badminton, Cricket, Chess. I believe I am the greated Formula 1 fan.
I love to watch formula one. I have taken lessons to fly Cessna 172. Occassionaly I do hobby flying.

Above all, I'm a firm believer in the power of kindness and compassion. Helping others, whether through sharing knowledge, lending a helping hand, or simply being there to listen, brings immense joy to my life. Let's make the world a better place together!
